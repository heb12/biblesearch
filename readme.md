# BibleSearch
This Python program takes multiple words, and searches them in the bible.
#
It takes advantage of sed and grep, to search data lists really fast.
#
To use compile.html, get JUBL2000.json
`wgethttp://api.heb12.com/translations/en/jubl2000.json`
Rename it to jubl2000.js and add `var jubl200 = ` at the start of it.
